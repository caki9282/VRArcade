The main loop of our game is you are a conductor for some space train and your goal is to keep the train running via shovleling space coal and other train maintance.

## Project Description

Become the ultimate space conductor in a thrilling game where you’re in charge of the Intergalactic Train Committee! Operate within a limited area, managing critical tasks aboard the star-bound freight train. Your mission? Keep the engines fueled and secure the precious cargo as you race through the cosmos. But beware—hostile alien lifeforms have their own ideas and will stop at nothing to disrupt your journey! Protect the cargo, fend off intruders, and ensure the train reaches its destination. Can you survive the journey, or will you face the wrath of the Intergalactic Train Committee?

## Feature Breakdown

In this section please fill out a table or list of the features you plan to implement for this project and how challenging you view them to be for you (on a scale of 1 to 5). Here is an example of the format I am looking for:

1. **Real time grabbing of objects**: Time slows down while the player is not moving and speeds up when they do
   **Estimated Challenge - 5:** The grabbing intertactions need to feel smooth and not cumborsum to keep holding onto an object{I am unsure how to do X and I thing Z may take a while to build out.}
2. **Fuel progress check**: As the train progresses more and more fuel is used to
       **Estimated Challenge - 5:**
3. **Alien Bandits try to fly in and steal the freight**: The aliens will b-line to the freight and you as the conductor have to shoot them down to stop them
   **Estimated Challenge - 5:**
4. **Tank Heat**: Manage the tank temprature to keep the train for the engine by turing a valve
   **Estimated Challenge - 5:**
5. (OPTIONAL) **Train repairs**: As the train is ransacked, parts will have to be boarded up and held togehter
   **Estimated Challenge - 5:**
6. **Multiple stops** The train has two stops before the final destinations, at theses stops you can purchace upgrades to improve the train
    **Estimated Challenge - 5:**

## Milestones

List here the progress you intend to make by each milestone check point. The dates I have represented here are actual due dates for project submissions. These will also be in class time to get feedback from me and other students, so you must have something ready to test by class on each of these days.

1. **By 11/19** - Train working enviorment set up. Base interactions implemented.
2. **By 11/26** - Test all base functionalities to ensure they are working before going into visual additions.
3. **By 12/5** - Refine and add approate visuals and audio sources, most bugs fixed.
