## Project Description

The player works wihtin a finite space in which that are able to operate their tasks. The game will take place in space where you are a conductor the international train commitee. The player moves fuel to the engine compartment, making sure the train get to its destination, but other lifeforms have different plans. You are exporting valueable goods in which you must project and secure. Fight off these intrudors or else the international train commitee will fire you! 

## Feature Breakdown

In this section please fill out a table or list of the features you plan to implement for this project and how challenging you view them to be for you (on a scale of 1 to 5). Here is an example of the format I am looking for:

1. **Time Dilation**: Time slows down while the player is not moving and speeds up when they do
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 5:** I am unsure how to do X and I thing Z may take a while to build out.
2. 

## Milestones

List here the progress you intend to make by each milestone check point. The dates I have represented here are actual due dates for project submissions. These will also be in class time to get feedback from me and other students, so you must have something ready to test by class on each of these days.

1. **By 11/19** - Implement time dilation and ….
2. **By 12/5** - …
